## GEmpathy: Privacy policy

Welcome to the GEmpathy game for Android!

This is a relaxing Android game for all audiences. 

As this is just a small game, using LibGDX, it is important to note that user privacy is fully respected as no personally identifiable user 
information, private or otherwise, is requested or used by it.

### Data collected by the app

I hereby state, to the best of my knowledge and belief, that this Androind game does not collect, store, or share any peronally identifiable user information.
It has not been programmed for such purposes.
The only data that the game handles is the savegame data (which is game-specific and contains no personaly identifiable information whatsoever) and it is 
only stored locally on the Android device.
This data can be simply erased by clearing the app's data or uninstalling it. 
The game requires no specific permissions to run.
No analytics software is present in the app.
